# Wallpaper.Net

# Wallpaper.Net Infatuation Gallery (an Open Source Gallery App)

#### 🎁 Project Introduction

Wallpaper.Net (Infatuation Gallery) is an open source wallpaper app based on Net+Vue+UNIAPP+TUNIAOUI, aiming to eliminate dependencies on other projects during development.

> Easy to learn, easy to use

The front-end is based on Vue+UNIAPP+TUNIAOUI and additional templates have been added to facilitate the implementation of more features. The back-end is based on .NET 8 (native encapsulation, independent of other encapsulations), with ORM using Sqlsugar and singleton mode, and developed in a plug-in style.

By modularizing common business scenarios in daily development, and adhering to a people-oriented and business-centered approach, Wallpaper.Net aims to provide a codebase that is ready to use out of the box, with clean and easily expandable code, detailed comments, and comprehensive documentation, reducing development time and complexity.

> Experience the pain points, see each other late! Make .NET development simpler, more universal, and more popular!

#### 🍖 Basic Design Concept

![Minimal Dependencies](https://gitee.com/Pridejoy/wallpaper.net/raw/master/doc/images/yilai.png)

* [ ]  Create database
* [ ]  Backend service (automatically updated daily)

- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

  Permissions, logging, exceptions, etc., are implemented through filters or middleware, providing centralized programming.
- Configurability
- Automatic registration

  Automatically register entities, service classes, etc.

## 🎀 Quick Start

##### 🍭 ORM Based on Sqlsugar

SqlSugar is a well-established open source ORM framework for .NET maintained and updated by the Fructose Big Data Technology team, and is the most user-friendly ORM framework. This system is also based on Sqlsugar's singleton mode, CodeFirst, and repository structure, eliminating the need to worry about scope issues, and making development straightforward!
